# Benchmark two

We ran 20 nodes with the following geographical distribution:

```
    - count: 2
      region: us-east-2
    - count: 3
      region: us-east-2
    - count: 3
      region: us-west-2
    - count: 3
      region: ap-south-1
    - count: 2
      region: ap-northeast-3
    - count: 3
      region: ap-northeast-2
    - count: 4
      region: eu-west-3
```


Here we explore if the number of active pins has any influence on propagation time,
we repeat the same benchmark as we did in 1), expect this time, we create 500k cids and pins before
we do the actual benchmark. Note that all instances from 1) were destroyed, and we started with a fresh set of nodes.
